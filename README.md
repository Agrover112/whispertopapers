# WhisperToPapers
This fork of talktopapers  showcases a simple demo as to how  OpenAI Whisper + Sentence Transformers mpnet (max seq length of 512) can be used for searching within a paper. Gpt-3 embeddings are a lot better given the training and sequence length.
A project to let you upload a paper to your drive and talk to it using Open AI's text embeddings. [Open the Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qv1Vhi36tumxRDTvzVt0XRjg6HTsMI6D?usp=sharing)
